Dumping Conversations

.. contents::

Generic Information
-------------------
On Examples
+++++++++++

The provided examples are for Linux and macOS if you're using windows, replace
``./slackdump`` with ``slackdump`` in the examples.

Output Format
+++++++++++++

The default output format for Conversations or Threads is ``json``.
Additionally, slackdump can generate a text file with formatted conversation.
To enable generation of the text file::

  slackdump format text <archive.zip or directory>

Save to Another Directory or ZIP File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Slackdump writes all files to the current directory.  Alternatively,
Slackdump can output files to another directory or even a ZIP file.  To make
Slackdump write to another directory or ZIP file:

Output to Directory with the name of "some_dir"::
  
  slackdump dump -o some_dir ...

Output to a ZIP file named "my_archive.zip"::

  slackdump -o my_archive.zip ...

Downloading file and image attachments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, Slackdump does fetches all files attached to messages.  To disable
fetching attachments, use ``-download`` flag::

  slackdump -files=false ...

If the base directory is set, it will use it to save attachments.

Using the Command Line
----------------------

To dump the conversations of interest, you must provide their IDs or URLs either
on the command line, or a file.

Providing the list on the command line::

  ./slackdump dump CXXXXXX DXXXXXXX https://xx.slack.com/archives/CXXXXXX

The URL can be URL of the conversation or thread.  Thread URLs are explained
in details later in this section.

Example
+++++++

You want to dump conversations with @alice and @bob to text files and save all
the files (attachments) that you all shared in those conversations::

  slackdump dump DNF3XXXXX DLY4XXXXX https://....
                 ━━━┯━━━━━ ━━━┯━━━━━ ━━━━┯━━━━━┅┅
                    │         │          │
                    │         ╰─: @alice │
                    ╰───────────: @bob   │
     thread or conversation URL :────────╯

Reading data from the file
--------------------------

Slackdump can read the list of the channels and URLs to dump from the
file.

1. Create the file that will contain all the necessary IDs and/or
   URLs, I'll use "links.txt" in the example.
2. Copy/paste all the IDs and URLs into that file, one per line.
3. Run slackdump with "@links.txt" on the command line::

     slackdump dump @links.txt
                    ━━━━┯━━━━━
                        │
                        ╰───────: instructs slackdump to use the file input

   "@" character instructs slackdump to read entries from the file.

File input can be combined with channel IDs or URLs, i.e.::

  slackdump dump CHANNELID1 @links.txt https://xx.slack.com/...

Conversation URL
----------------

To get the conversation URL link, use this simple trick that they
won't teach you at school:

1. In Slack Client, right click on the conversation you want to dump (in the
   channel navigation pane on the left)
2. Choose "Copy link".

Thread URL
----------

1. In Slack, open the thread that you want to dump.
2. The thread opens to the right of the main conversation window
3. On the first message of the thread, click on three vertical dots menu (not
   sure how it's properly called), choose "Copy link"

Run the slackdump and provide the URL link as an input::

  slackdump -files=true  https://xxxxxx.slack.com/archives/CHM82GX00/p1577694990000400
            ━┯━━━━━━━━━  ━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
             │                 ╰─────: URL of the thread
             ╰──────────────: save files (default)

Internal Thread Link Format
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Slackdump also supports the internal format of the thread identifier for
brevity.  It has the format of CHANNEL:THREAD, i.e.
``CHM82GX00:1577694990.000400``, for the example above.
